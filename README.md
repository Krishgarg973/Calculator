## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Basic Operations
- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division (with divide-by-zero check)

### 🔹 Scientific Operations
- 📐 Sine (`sin`)  
- 📏 Cosine (`cos`)  
- 📈 Tangent (`tan`)  
- 🧮 Square Root (`sqrt`)  
- 🧠 Natural Logarithm (`log`)

🧠 Concepts Used
	•	OOP & Encapsulation — Organizing code using classes and methods.
	•	Java Math Library — Using built-in math functions.
	•	Switch-Case — For selecting operations.
	•	Scanner — For user input.
	•	Error Handling — Prevent invalid operations (e.g., divide by zero, log of negative numbers).
